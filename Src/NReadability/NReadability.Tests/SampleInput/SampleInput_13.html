One of the supreme ironies among the European moral stances has to do with their discourse on the death penalty. It is a standard trope of European contempt for the USA that it still has a death penalty, a sign of its cowboy nature and its retardation in the moral progress of nations.

<h1>What Gilad Shalit tells us about the respect for life in
Europe, Israel and Palestine</h1>
<h2>The exchange of a thousand Palestinian prisoners for a single
Israeli soldier shows us what life means in the Jewish state, says

<p>One of the supreme ironies among the European moral stances has
to do with their discourse on the death penalty. <a href="http://www.fdp.dk/uk/int-crit.htm">It is a standard trope of
European contempt for the USA that it still has a death
penalty</a>, a sign of its cowboy nature and its retardation in the
moral progress of nations.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><a href="http://www.theaugeanstables.com/2011/10/23/the-hostage-prisoner-exchange-and-the-world-of-imaginative-sympathy/"><strong>• Read a longer version of this
article at Richard Landes&#8217;s blog</strong></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>And yet when that same Europe turns its gaze on the Middle East,
the country they have the most contempt for is the only country in
the entire region to reject capital punishment, and they have the
most admiration for a country that among a widespread political
culture that extensively uses torture and execution for the
maintenance of public order, shows perhaps the most contempt for
the lives of its own peoples and its enemies.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Normally, this would not be even worth mentioning. Most people
would just roll their eyes while others complain about Zionist
imperialists trying to divert attention from their oppression of
the Palestinians. But if you want to understand the
“hostage-for-prisoner-exchange” that just took place in
Israel and the Western media’s coverage of the event, then
you need to pay attention to the issue.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Israel first outlawed the death penalty in 1954, thus reversing
the Mandate Law, which, in most other instances, Israel took over
from the British. They based themselves both on rabbinic precedent
(concerns for both respecting the image of God in man and the
unattainable burden of proof) and modern liberal sentiment. In
doing so, they became the first modern Western democracy to ban the
death penalty, followed a decade later by Britain (1965), Sweden
(1972), Canada (1976) and France (1981).</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Note that Israel passed this law five years after the creation
of a polity dedicated to equality before the law for all its
citizens, a move that earned them the ferocious hostility of their
neighbors in the Arab Muslim world. Normally, when countries
attempt these egalitarian revolutions and find themselves
surrounded by hostile enemies, they have, by year five, descended
into mass executions of their own citizens (French Revolution in
their fourth year, Russians, Chinese, Cambodians, almost
immediately). Israel, on the other hand, outlawed the death penalty
even for Arab terrorists who were captured while killing Israeli
civilians. Israel has only executed one person, Adolph Eichmann,
held responsible for the extermination of millions of Jews during
the Holocaust.</p>
<p>If the Israelis had hundreds of terrorists in their prisons, in
some cases serving multiple life sentences, available to trade for
Gilad Shalit, a soldier kidnapped from Israeli soil by Hamas
combatants five years ago, it’s because of this attitude
towards human life, both their own and those of the Palestinians.
And that attitude was on full display throughout this exchange,
with agonising over endangering future Israelis by releasing these
men contrasting with a profound commitment to getting Gilad Shalit
back. <a href="http://gulfnews.com/opinions/columnists/israel-s-shalit-eclipses-arab-shalloots-1.894395">Some Arabs recognised the unflattering light this
shed on their own culture</a>, while <a href="http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=1508">others revelled in it</a>.</p>
<p>Palestine, on the other hand, represents almost the polar
opposite. This is a place in which killing daughters and wives and
homosexuals for shaming the family with (even suspected and loosely
interpreted) inappropriate sexual behavior is <a href="http://www.worldandi.com/newhome/public/2003/may/clpub.asp">a
regular feature of society</a>, where <a href="http://fromoccupiedpalestine.org/node/944">“collaborators” are summarily executed</a>,
where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment#Global_distribution">official statistics for executions put the PA</a>
at a rate of formal, legal execution that cedes only to China,
Iran, N Korea, Yemen and Libya.</p>
<p>The trade of over a thousand Palestinians for one Israeli
highlights the radical differences between the cultures. As
Hizbullah’s Nasrullah put it after a prison exchange in 2004:
“We have discovered how to hit the Jews where they are the
most vulnerable. The Jews love life, so that is what we shall take
away from them. We are going to win, because they love life and we
love death.”</p>
<p>If a European, concerned about the nature of the aggressive
Islam that has begun to crop up in his cities, citing for example
Sharia zones, wanted to understand the nature of the Arab-Israeli
conflict, he might spend a moment visiting the sites of Palestinian
anti-Zionists, where this profoundly perverse culture teems. But of
course, that would be politically incorrect. To spend any time
pointing out the problems here constitutes the highest level of
politically incorrect Islamophobia.</p>
<p>So instead of helping Europeans understand what’s at
stake, most of the media and the NGO community have spun this story
as one of violations of human rights on “both sides”
with <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/michaelweiss/100092713/psc-comes-to-parliament-bringing-a-man-accused-of-saying-jews-bake-bread-with-the-blood-of-gentiles/">
a heavy focus on Israeli misdeeds</a>. The prisoners were
considered “equal,” and Israeli primarily held
accountable by the Geneva Convention for the treatment of enemy
combatants when, in reality, the only one protected under these
conditions was Shalit, a uniformed soldier kidnapped on his own
soil in non-combat situation, and the thousand Palestinian
prisoners where convicted in a court, primarily of crimes related
to terror attacks on civilians (an, alas, necessary redundancy in
these days of sophism).</p>
<p>Thus, <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/video-and-photos-of-the-israeli-palestinian-prisoner-swap/">The New York Times’s Robert Mackee could
speak glibly</a> about the “joy of parents on both
sides” at the return of prisoners, and <a href="http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/un-concern-at-fate-of-palestinian-detainees">the UN could voice its concern</a> that the
prisoners Israel released might be subject to illegal forced
transfer. “Returning people to places other than their
habitual places of residence is in contradiction to international
humanitarian law.” The UN’s concern for the full
exercise of free will by convicted mass murderers illustrates the
problem. Humanitarian discourse has been turned on its head to
protect the ugliest players in this particular game, <a href="http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/10/18/172380.html">threatened by ugly forces within their own society</a>,
all the while implying that Israel, in its haste to get its own
soldier back, trampled their rights and violated humanitarian law.
Not surprisingly this led Ban Ki Moon to a moment of <a href="http://pajamasmedia.com/claudiarosett/the-moral-vertigo-of-ban-ki-moon/?singlepage=true">moral vertigo</a> where he <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/18/us-palestinians-israel-un-idUSTRE79H1W720111018">denounced the violation of everyone’s
rights</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, in order to present the moral equivalence of all the
“prisoners” in the swap, one has to play down the
heinous nature of the crimes and personalities of the Palestinian
prisoners released. BBC correspondent Jon Donnison showed the
extent of ignorance among the supposedly professional news media by
interviewing a man in prison for organising and abetting several
suicide bombings. (Because the attacks only injured but did not
kill, he did not receive life sentences.) “You are 31 years
old, 10 years in prison, serving a life sentence for being a member
of Hamas, I mean, how do you feel today?” BBC viewers could
be excused for sympathising with a political prisoner, inhumanly
incarcerated for belonging to an opposition party, free at
last.</p>
<p>In acquiescing with a narrative in which hatred and murder are
considered legitimate expressions of “resistance” to
“occupation,” Western human rights activists –
including many journalists – have <a href="http://www.ngo-monitor.org/index.php">degraded
humanitarian language</a> at the same time as they have allowed
into the public sphere a discourse of genocidal hatred. They have
excluded any sympathy for Israelis who defend themselves from the
onslaught they have shut out from their and their audiences’
consciousness. <a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/washington-diarist/magazine/96120/justice-jebusites-nusseibeh-grossman-storace-end-land">As Leon Wieseltier put it in a different
context</a>, this all reflects “the new heartlessness toward
Israel. A whole country and a whole people have been expelled from
the realm of imaginative sympathy.”</p>
<p>It may seem cost-free to Westerners, but it’s not. In
misreading the nature of the threat Israel faces, in adopting a
degraded language of human rights to protect the greatest enemies
of human rights on the planet, in adopting a <a href="http://eureferendum.blogspot.com/2006/08/corruption-of-media.html">corrupted advocacy journalism</a> that masquerades
as empirically accurate, they embrace <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2011/10/21/progressives-islamists-huddle-at-justice-department/">all the kinds of techniques</a> that put them in
danger when faced with the same enemy.</p>
